    "Description Engilish": "We found that the process of preparing fabrics using the kumo technique matched our dataset very well; we felt that there was an intuitive link between the expression of stress and the act of collecting fabrics to form a series of knots. In our early experiments with kumo, we found the process of preparing fabric to be almost ritualised. It requires patience and attention and therefore can be used as a therapeutic behaviour. Thus, we saw an opportunity to use the preparation process (collecting small areas and tying them with rubber bands) as a direct input to the final representation. (This means that the final output is not a symbolic representation pattern imposed on the dataset, but appears organically as an indexed representation of the data.) Thus, creating these knots can help alleviate the pressure they are meant to embody.\n\n\"Stress Blanket.\"\nFinally, we chose to create a personalised blanket using Shibori dyed fabrics. We saw this as an opportunity to once again combine data with physical representation and chose to create an object that would provide comfort during times of stress.",

    "Description Engilish": "\"Between 30 and 50 per cent of cancer cases are preventable. Prevention offers the most cost-effective long-term strategy for controlling cancer\" (World Health Organisation).\n\nCurrently, in Italy, awareness of cancer spread and prevention is rather low, despite the existence of many educational websites, printed materials and online campaigns. On average, cancer is still considered as a fatal disease, which can affect information processing. Information avoidance is indeed a typical behaviour, especially when it comes to cancer-related issues.\n\nAt TedMed Milan 2017, organised by the Politecnico di Milano in Italy, KnowAndBe.live, a startup dedicated to cancer prevention awareness, asked us to design an information-rich experience that would be able to communicate to the audience about cancer prevention in a new way. Such a delicate topic. The main requirements were to raise awareness of best practices in cancer prevention, avoid traditional top-down healthcare communication, and potentially gather information about participants' knowledge at the same time. After several workshops and conferences featuring a co-design approach, we defined a participatory data physicalisation that aims to go beyond the boundaries of normal data physicalisation and transform it into a participatory experience.\nWhat are we talking about? We are referring to the emerging field of data visualisation, known as physicalisation, consisting of physical objects that represent data and then create information. Data becomes tangible and experienceable through shapes and materials, driving information through a new (physical) paradigm. But what happens when the physicalisation of data becomes a participatory experience where people actively contribute to the shared experience with their actions? Dell's cone of experience gives us a hint of what might happen.",

In geology, marble is metamorphic limestone, and historically, marble has been widely used in architecture and figurative sculpture. (In fact, stone sculpture is one of the earliest forms of art, predating paintings on cave walls.) Culturally, marble has become a symbol of tradition and refined taste.\n\nIn my artwork series entitled \"Arctic Sea Ice/Albedo\", I converted photographic data of Arctic sea ice patterns into a digitally modelled surface. The template was cut using a CNC milling machine and a glass casting kiln. The concept of the data is physically represented through the translucent material of the glass.

We are particularly interested in exploring how such a familiar concept can be so elusive and difficult to define.\nIn making this installation, with the help of our partners in crime at Hamill Industries, we combined two key elements: play and materiality.\nFirstly, we know from experience that through play and interaction we can create a more honest and emotional connection with visitors. Secondly, when considering materiality, we were keen to use ink and paper similar to those used in traditional Chinese crafts.

As one of the most anticipated attractions at the Expo, the pavilion demonstrates an innovative approach to architecture that focuses on the harmonious relationship between the urban environment and the natural world.\n\nThe centrepiece of the UK Pavilion is the Cathedral of Seeds, a 20-metre high structure made up of 60,000 transparent fibre optic rods, each containing a seed at its tip. These dazzlingly illuminated seeds, sourced from the Royal Botanic Gardens' Millennium Seed Bank and the Kunming Institute of Botany in China, form a celestial constellation of plant diversity. The Cathedral's ethereal glow and gentle movement with the wind creates a dynamic, immersive experience for visitors, promoting introspection and reverence for the world's plant species.",

This media installation concludes the tour of the museum (former salt mine).\n\n34 touch-sensitive salt crystals are distributed on a world map highlighting the largest salt mines. Depending on the amount of salt mined in these areas, millions of grains of salt are discharged onto the world map, sliding down the ridges and then spreading and flowing with the major sea currents.\n\nWhen the crystal is touched, it begins to glow. The salt grains are poured onto a table and merge into an information window which displays detailed information about the selected salt mine in the form of text, images and film.\n\nDuring the guided tour, the museum guide explains in a ten-minute sequence the global production, consumption, use of salt and other related topics. Each topic is illustrated through computationally generated animations.\n\nThe installation offers a new approach to learning through a dynamic and immersive experience. The behaviour of the salt world is based on algorithmic parameters, providing a vivid and ever-changing experience over time.",

The purpose of the work is to create an experience that provides a one-to-one relationship between the world's population and its data: each living person is represented by a point of light. \"The Population Theatre is a material representation of human existence, and as such it can be used to create \"data dramatisations\" that help visitors visualise areas of political economy, cultural studies, sociology, anthropology, psychology, history, communications and more. Data can be presented using a content management system with automated or interactive playlists of 10-minute vignettes created by different data performers. People can stand on the stage to watch the presentation, but they are also encouraged to walk along the corridor between the 'rows' of monitors, physically 'zooming in' to see individual perxons, reversing the panoramic view and reviewing the public stage. Each monitor produces subtle feedback sounds as the data changes, and walking along the corridor creates a spatialised sound experience.",

Our simple fabrication techniques also give users the freedom to design and print in a variety of colours to create custom designs for specific applications. Through a series of application examples, we demonstrate the technical capabilities of Skintillates as sensors and as expressive personal and private displays. Finally, we detail the results of a series of user studies that highlight the user experience, comfort, durability, acceptability and application potential of Skintillates.",

With the Emotional Biosensing Display we sought to explore an alternative approach to having emotions interpreted by machines, in which users can form their own interpretations and feel comfortable criticising the display. We therefore designed, implemented and deployed the Emotional Biosensing Display as a technological inquiry: the Ripple is a shirt whose pattern changes colour in response to the wearer's skin conductivity, which has been linked to arousal.17 Participants wore the Ripple over two days of daily life.While some participants expressed appreciation for the \" physical connection,\" for others, the Ripple created insecurity about \"how much\" they felt emotionally. Despite our design intent, we found that participants rarely questioned the relationship between the display and their emotions. We utilised biopolitics to speculate on Ripple's surprising authority, highlighting the ethical stakes that biosensory representations have on self-awareness and ways of feeling.",

Previous interaction design work examining physiological data such as heart pulse has argued that feeding this data back to the user can help them become more mindful and self-aware in a variety of daily activities, ultimately promoting their physical and mental health. Inspired by the discipline of somatosensory aesthetics, we have designed and explored multimodal displays that enable people to experience heartbeats as natural stimuli from themselves and others in their social neighbourhood. In this paper, we report on the design process for our design, PiHearts, and present qualitative findings from a field study with 30 pairs of participants.\nParticipants were asked to use PiHearts while watching a short film together and to report on their perceptual experiences in three different display conditions while watching the film. For example, we found that participants experienced a significant effect on sensory immersion when they received their own heartbeat as a stimulus compared to a condition without any heartbeat display, and that feeling their partner's heartbeat had a significant effect on the social experience. We invoke resonance theory to explain and discuss these results, highlighting the potential resonance of digitising heartbeats as rhythmic natural stimuli in a modern society facing accelerated social development.",

In his book, Plutchik describes eight basic human emotions: happiness, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, and anticipation. He created a diagram in which these eight emotions, along with their weakened and amplified counterparts, form a three-dimensional cone of 24 regions. The cone is the basic form of the pulse and can be amplified in 24 directions for different emotions. Whenever an emotion label or its synonym is found in a recent blog entry, the morphing object changes itself in such a way that the new volume represents a part of the overall emotional state of the current Internet surfer.",

The first image shows the grouping by day, where each column shows the impact of the food consumed by the person who provided the data on that day.

Through the creation of handmade physicalised and sonified works, we suggest three themes for the production of personal data narratives: matching data to materials (and vice versa), the willingness to accept the co-creation of materials, and the negotiation between the experience of data and the data of experience.",

In addition, the clear differentiation of the book being read improves the visual affordance and accessibility of the book for users to start reading. Based on the results of the study, we confirm the possibility of materialising intangible data for self-reflection, thus facilitating changes in behaviours that are difficult to implement due to poor motivation.",

Findings showed that DayClo supported users' casual access to scheduling data and prompted them to self-track their plans. In addition, the moving clock hands showed free time in their schedules, helping to create new plans for their implicit goals. Our findings provide new opportunities for designing everyday objects as a medium for delivering and facilitating spontaneous interactions with personal data for self-reflection.",

We designed GraFeet - an enhanced running shoe that visualises kinematic data from a runner's foot and gait. In a user study, we compared our prototype to a standard sensor dashboard. Users found the GraFeet to work better, generate more insights, and reduce user confusion.

In this paper, we develop a device called ADIO that enhances the audiobook experience by presenting an individual's listening state in the form of an interactive physical bookshelf.\nThe ADIO displays the user's listening progress through variations in the length of the pendant and the title of the user's digital audiobook file. Our four-week field study with six participants showed that ADIO provided users with proof of listening, brought about a sense of reading, and triggered recall of audiobook content already listened to. In addition, increased audiobook visibility reminded participants to listen to audiobooks, and the physical interactions of ADIO allowed participants to develop personal patterns of audiobook listening. Our findings suggest new ways to enhance the audiobook listening experience at three stages and have further implications for the design of physical curation of users' digital archives.",

However, parental understanding is crucial to the emotional development of adolescents. However, conveying emotions can be challenging, and therefore, mediums that facilitate parent-child communication can benefit. To help raise parental awareness, we have designed Motiis, a novel system that measures and visualises the emotions experienced by children during play. Haptic feedback allows the user to 'feel' the level of emotion displayed.\nThe system was evaluated in 17 parent-child pairs through an on-site evaluation. The results show that Motiis helps to increase parents' emotional awareness. The tangible and haptic aspects of the system help the user to engage with the data more consciously, as the tangible visualisation of the system requires active interaction with the user.Motiis enables parents to be aware of their child's emotional state in ways that are beyond the child's verbal communication skills.",

The fashion pictured above shows the concentrations of 100 chemical pollutants measured in the air of a household (left). The chemicals are mapped onto small squares, and the relative concentrations are mapped onto the size of the squares. The squares repeat to form a lace pattern (the right image shows concentrations of several factory-related pollutants).\n\nIn her paper, Laura Perovich discusses how data garments could be used in the future to raise awareness of air pollution:\nWe can imagine that the prints on the clothes would change as the chemicals to which they are exposed change; that the shape and stiffness of the clothes would change to make them feel uncomfortable, thus encouraging people to leave heavily polluted areas; or that the clothes would provide air filtration in polluted spaces, thus improving protection. These types of projects will improve understanding by providing relevant information on an ongoing basis and prompting people to act on these realisations.",

    "Description Engilish": "The 'Sphere Pack' is a series of 3D-printed spheres designed to bring together a composer's entire musical oeuvre in a dense, multi-channel device. For example, Johann Sebastian Bach's sphere is 48 centimetres in diameter and can accommodate 1,100 speakers playing 1,100 different Bach compositions simultaneously, while Hildegaard Von Bingen's sphere is only 11 centimetres in diameter and has only 69 speakers. The project demonstrates at a glance the comparative output of many composers' works.\nWhen people are a few metres away from the sphere they hear a quiet murmur, but when they approach and put their ears close to the individual speakers they are able to listen to specific compositions. The collection is inspired by American composer Charles Ives' use of simultaneity as a compositional tool.\n\nTechnically, a set of customised circuit boards can play thousands of individual channels simultaneously. The spheres are modelled algorithmically and then 3D printed in different materials according to the composer's requirements: porcelain, steel, polymer, stainless steel, and so on. Each piece is suspended from a small playback box, which hangs from the ceiling of the exhibition space.",

The work juxtaposes the immediacy of social media posts with the separate identities we create for ourselves online, which are often detached from our physical presence. The work also speaks to the use of wearable technology and the ability to track daily steps, sleep, mood and other personal information as a standard practice.

    "Description Engilish": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers great potential for planning, guiding, monitoring and controlling interventions. Magnetic resonance arthrography (MRAr) is the imaging gold standard for assessing damage to the small joint ligaments and fibrocartilage. In contemporary practice, MRAr consists of two consecutive sessions: (1) an interventional session in which a needle is inserted into the joint space and MR contrast is injected under fluoroscopic or CT guidance; and (2) a diagnostic session of MRI imaging to visualise the distribution of the contrast within the joint space and to assess the joint condition.\nOur MRAr method performs these tasks on a conventional high-field closed-field MRI scanner, thereby eliminating the separate radiographically guided needle insertion and contrast agent injection processes. We propose a 2D augmented reality image overlay device for guiding the puncture needle insertion procedure. This approach allows diagnostic high-field magnets to be used for interventions without the need for complex and expensive engineering aids. In preclinical trials, we used the magnetic resonance image superimposition guidance device to perform punctures in porcine and human cadaveric joints; in all cases, the puncture needle successfully reached the joint space on the first attempt.",

We combined living plants with sensors and lights to produce an interactive display and create a robot that mimics phototropic behaviour. This paper documents our design process and reports the results of a two-week field study.\nWe placed the live plant display and its corresponding robot between a pair of trash and recycling containers in the cafeteria. The placement of recyclables or trash triggered directional beams that gradually tilted the plant display towards the more active container. In interviews, people explained the reasons for the plant displays and talked about caring for the plants. There was a slight increase in people's recycling behaviour where live plants were displayed (p=.08). There was also a significant increase in people's recycling behaviour at the robotic display and at the light-only display. Our findings suggest that there is value in exploring the use of living materials and biomimetic forms in displays, as well as the use of lightweight robots to provide simple rewards.",

    "Description Engilish": "This paper describes how the physical world can be detected in such a way that objects can describe themselves, communicating their identity, geometry and other information such as history or user annotations. The enabling technology is a wireless tag that acts as a radio frequency identity and geometry (RFIG) transponder. We show how adding a photo sensor to a wireless tag can greatly extend its functionality to enable geometric manipulation, such as finding the tag's 3D location, or detecting changes in the shape of the tagged object. Tag data is projected directly to the user by using a handheld locally aware mobile projector.\nWe introduce a new technique called interactive projection that allows the user to interact with the projected information, e.g. to navigate or update the projected information. However, this work is motivated by the emergence of powerless passive RFID technology, which promises to have a significant impact on real-world applications. We will discuss how current prototypes could evolve into passive RFID technology in the future.",

Second, we report on efforts to capture data on the street environment, particularly vehicular traffic. Third, we draw on the possibilities offered by polling techniques.\nWe reflect on how these engagements: crystallise the unique relationship between communities and their data; surface the flows and contours of data, as well as spatial, temporal and social boundaries; and create a multiplicity of 'small worlds'.

Students must be able to traverse representations of data (e.g., numbers, graphs, etc.) and connect them to their understanding of a topic. We explored the implementation of a co-designed Data-Dance unit in which secondary school students created their own embodied metaphors to represent and communicate graphics through dance. Through analysing the dance work and post-school interviews with learners and teachers, we demonstrated how the creation of embodied metaphors in dance led to new ways of exploring data, and how learners were able to reflect on the theme from different perspectives with different values, contexts and meanings.",

    "Description Engilish": "Data physicalisation (3D printed terrain models, anatomical scans, and even abstract data) can naturally engage the visual and tactile senses in a way that is difficult or impossible to do with traditional flat touchscreens or even immersive digital displays. However, the rigid 3D physicalisation produced by today's most common 3D printers fundamentally limits data exploration and querying tasks that require dynamic inputs (e.g., touch sensing) and outputs (e.g., animation) that can be easily handled by digital displays. We introduce a novel hybrid virtual+physical visualisation style specifically designed to support interactive data exploration tasks.\nTo achieve a \"best of both worlds\" solution, our approach combines immersive AR, physical 3D data printouts and touch sensing through physicalisation. We demonstrate that the solution can support the three most common spatial data query interactions used in scientific visualisation (streamline seeding, dynamic cut location and micro-world visualisation). Finally, we present quantitative performance data and describe the first application of an exploratory visualisation of supercomputer climate simulation data that is actively being investigated with feedback from scientists in the field.",

Users can only receive their search results when they exert an effort equal to the energy required to search by riding a bicycle (see Figure 1).\n\nMove&Find is a type of multisensory data expression, referred to by Hogan and Hornecker as \"a type of data expression that explicitly intends to reveal insight by encoding data in multiple expression modes, and requires at least two sensory channels to fully interpret and understand underlying data\" (page 3). More specifically, Move&Find encodes the energy required for Google search by the force required to move the bicycle's rear wheels (i.e. the number of rotations of the wheels). A tablet computer was installed in front of the bicycle, displaying a visualization of the distance traveled. Although the relevant data is encoded in the visual and physical properties of Move&Find, it is only revealed when the user interacts with the device. Only a sporty experience can reveal the data it represents. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the value of this sporty experience, we have raised a more specific question: What is the value expressed by the multisensory data in Move&Find compared to the same device that lacks a sporty experience?",

This artwork utilizes an easily accessible customized online survey to collect information on the feelings of residents of East Boston towards the impact of rising sea levels in their community. Their reactions and emotions are visualized and transformed into an art installation, using color bands to represent future flood levels in the background of the Boston Public Library East Boston branch. Encourage participants in online surveys to participate in ongoing government and grassroots efforts around resilience. This project attempts to pilot a new hybrid model that combines art and social technology for data collection and visualization, promoting fair resilience and inclusive planning by increasing public participation.\n\nThe device consists of a ribbon placed on a steel frame in front of the East Boston branch of the Boston Public Library. These straps pass through the terrace and press upwards against the windows of the building. The height of the frames and lines on the building represents the height at which 1% of the annual flood is expected to occur at this specific location in 2070 (approximately 3.7 feet). This data was provided by the Boston Sustainable Solutions Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts.\n\nThe project asked residents how they feel about the severe impact of floods caused by climate change on East Boston. Their answers are color coded into five emotions: care, optimism, anger, sadness, and others. Care is represented in blue, optimism in yellow, anger in red, sadness in deep blue, and others in green. Over 150 residents participated in the online survey within two weeks. Their responses showed that the majority of people felt worried (51%), followed by optimism (17%), sadness (14%), anger (9%), and \"other\" (9%).

The work involves an extension of the landscape of Boston Port, which is composed of the new buildings of the Boston Institute of Contemporary Art and Spectacle Island located on the downtown waterfront. Glasses Island is a former landfill and landfill park, clearly visible on the coast. These two locations have a dialogue function, questioning what is seen and what is unseen, preserved and recorded, as well as what is suppressed and denied.\n\nTourists can take the Island Express ferry from Long Pier for 15 minutes to reach Glasses Island, and can borrow earphones for free at the Glasses Island Visitor Center. The sound will automatically play based on each tourist's unique itinerary. The theme sound content changes with the altitude contour of the path system, implying the vertical hierarchy of the metaphorical core sample (see installation map). Abstract sounds and spoken language blur the surface and core, nature and artificial, industry and organic, past, present, and future.\n\nThe installation also exists at the Founder's Gallery of the Boston Institute of Contemporary Art, where a 99 foot sound sculpture appears as an architectural element, installed along the length of the gallery, providing a panoramic view of Boston Harbor.",

When new articles are published in major journals, the VADER algorithm analyzes and categorizes them based on their positive or negative emotions. Then explain these results and transform them into sound and visual meanings, so that the audio-visual devices and data can be represented accordingly.\n\n\"NEWS FEED\" is a triple device consisting of a sound sculpture (Figure 3), a display screen and projection (Figure 2), and a visual projection (Figure 1). The sound sculpture will sound the article being read, the display screen and projection will display the current news story being read and analyzed, and the visual projection will map the data to visual meaning.\n\nThe plan of the exhibition is to allow the audience to first see and hear sound installations, then visualize them, and finally display or wait for analysis of text/news reports. In this way, the audience first enters the work through sensory experience, and then overcomes sensory experience in the background of the news story, thus establishing a dialogue between the three works.",

At a seminar, six non professional users successfully assembled functional balloons, validating our technology as a DIY tool for visualizing public air quality.

    "Description Engilish": "In our public visualization \"Street Infographics\", we attach leisure information visualization boards to existing street signs in the medium-sized city of Leuven, Belgium. Here, the planning of student residential areas has raised concerns about uneven distribution among students, foreigners, and permanent residents. Our goal is to inform residents of the actual situation of the social population composition.\nTherefore, we collected social and demographic data for four specific streets and visualized two data dimensions, namely the number of permanent residents and whether they are locals. We distributed these data dimensions of street residents by categorizing 100 information icons (Figure 1). The visual graphic design imitates the characteristics of street signs in terms of color scheme, font selection, and physical size. The back of each logo clearly indicates the actual data source. By attaching visualization to existing street signs, we cleverly broke through the daily environment. Although the visualization does not explicitly specify the location of the data representation, attaching it to existing street signs implies that it is information for that specific street. We have visualized the four adjacent streets, allowing passersby to explore other signs of the surrounding environment for data-based comparison.",

    "Description Engilish": "The data is based on a 2012 local survey showing the top five prevalent issues in this specific community. The overall goal of intervention is to inform residents of the actual situation regarding several epidemic issues, encourage them to reflect on these issues, and trigger social discussions in the community. The data was collected from the local government [1] and visualized as a star chart with 9 data dimensions, namely income, green space area, health, migration, foreign born citizens, illegal dumping, retail sales, neighborhood connections, idle time, and average age, each dimension depicted as a unique star chart. The main visualization displays several statistical data of the local community. This representation is compared through 8 smaller star charts, each representing the same data for 8 nearby communities in the same city. Three eye-catching qualitative comments from the local community regarding one of the issues were displayed, such as \"This region may become too expensive for ordinary people.\". The star chart visualization and referencing alternate through animated transitions, and the data source is clearly visible on the projection.\nWe used a mobile projector powered by a car battery, car, Raspberry Pi, and projector. Due to its physical size of approximately 3 meters by 3 meters and its extraordinary location in urban environments, the projection is particularly eye-catching. We have never announced when and where to deploy the projection, sometimes appearing in multiple areas simultaneously in one night. We project onto an abandoned factory surrounded by cafes and restaurants in the middle of the community. In the coming months, this factory will be demolished, raising concerns among locals about the new use of the space. For those who understand this issue, visualization seems to be related to it, as some data dimensions involve opportunities for redevelopment, such as limited green space and uneven income distribution. However, even without understanding this issue, visualization is always easy to understand, relevant, and meaningful.",

The overall purpose of our design is to enable citizens to explore their cities from a data centric perspective and encourage them to find meaningful connections between the displayed data and statistical data.\nThe appearance of this device is similar to the preliminary prototype; It doesn't look exquisite, but highlights the typical bottom-up, DIY characteristics of temporary intervention. Its physical design is similar to urban telescopes, both familiar and unfamiliar, enough to arouse the curiosity of passersby. The external height of the device is 1.80 meters, width is 0.30 meters, and depth is 0.60 meters. Inside the device, people are invited to explore ten different datasets, such as birth rate, number of residents, unemployment rate, number of beneficiaries, vulnerable groups, number of parks, amount of waste, income, energy use, and CO2 emissions. We have generated a time series line chart for each dataset, spanning from 2003 to 2011, which has been normalized for accurate comparison. The graphic lines are engraved on a transparent Plexiglas (30 x 30 cm) board. Each board is labeled with its dataset title and information source. The telescope itself is equipped with three slots, allowing users to insert a board, view the telescope through the inserted transparent board, and then compare up to three datasets. There is no clear visualization indicating where the data comes from, which leads to some vague reflections (such as, is it data about the entire country, province, or city?). However, the obvious telescope metaphor encourages passersby to further explain the environmental background and associate visualization with their environment.",

Hypertension is known as the \"silent killer\" due to its lack of symptoms, and it is an important factor in many life-threatening diseases.\nFor centuries, the song bowl has been associated with reducing stress and maintaining health. The antique bowl is handmade from alloys of up to seven metals, which may include gold, silver, mercury, copper, iron, tin, lead, zinc, nickel, and other trace elements. The handcrafted shape and alloy mean that each bowl has its own unique distinctive color tone. Nowadays, bronze cast singing bowls are more uniform in shape, material, and sound.\nThe shape of the hypertension bowl is constructed through computer-aided design based on blood pressure readings, resulting in personalized and unique shapes. Then digitize this shape using stainless steel to create an acoustic object that produces a tone when rubbed against a wooden \"puja\" rod.\nThe acoustic characteristics of singing bowls vary from person to person. The upper part of the singing bowl is shaped based on daily systolic blood pressure, while the lower part is shaped based on daily diastolic blood pressure. The meditation sound it produces is not only a means of reducing stress, but also reminds people to monitor their health status and cultivate a healthy lifestyle.",

Based on the duration of time the participant's heart rate stays between 60 and 95 beats per minute, the system drives a liquid pump to \"spray\" ingredients into the cup. The system design inspiration comes from the exaggerated actions of bartenders pouring alcohol from bottles (such as pouring from a height).\n\nIf the participant's heart rate is between 96 and 130 beats per minute, the system will add lightly seasoned water. If the heart rate is between 131 and 165, the system will add electrolyte containing liquid. Finally, if the heart rate is between 166 and 195, the system will add water with a strong taste.

This may require considering multiple standards, and most standards are not always self-evident or insignificant. This work suggests using a combination of data visualization and augmented reality (AR) user interface to help users determine the most convenient seat. We considered any set of requirements and projected the information directly onto the top of the seats and around the room. Users can also narrow down their search range by switching and combining displayed attributes such as temperature and wheelchair accessibility.\nIn the availability assessment of seat selection tasks for a group of 16 users, the proposed method was tested with comparable two-dimensional interactive visualization of the same data to validate the solution. Qualitative and quantitative data indicate that solutions based on augmented reality technology have broad prospects, indicating that augmented reality technology can help users make more accurate decisions, even in ordinary daily tasks. Our research findings on enhancing situational visualization have opened up new avenues for exploring situational awareness data.",

    "Description Engilish": "In the field of electrical engineering, hardware experts often need to analyze electromagnetic radiation data to detect any external interference or abnormal situations. The field of studying such evaluations is called Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC). As a method to support electromagnetic compatibility analysis, we recommend using Enhanced Scenario Visualization (ASV) to provide visual and interactive information for professionals, helping them understand this data and place it in the most relevant position in the spatial environment. Users can interact with visualization, change the displayed attributes, compare the overlap of multiple fields, and extract data to improve the search. In a series of data extraction evaluations conducted with users, comparable 2D and 3D interactive visualizations of the same data were tested to validate the proposed solution in this work.\nThe results indicate that there is a trade-off between correctness and time in the interaction methods. Hand based techniques (hand sliders and touch lenses) are the least prone to errors, with an error rate close to half that of line of sight based methods. Touching the lens is also the least time-consuming method, with an average time consumption of less than half of other methods. Among the visualization methods tested, the 2D ray casting method has a higher usability score and a lower workload index than the 3D topology view, but the error rate exposed is more than twice that of the 3D topology view.",

The participatory evaluation conducted by the author and four groups of stakeholders showed that OccSim can identify specific risks of virus transmission in advance and elucidate the relationship between each risk and complex human building interactions, thereby improving their decision-making process. The author reflected on the design and discussed the potential impact of OccSim in the fields of design evaluation, generative design, and digital twins.",

    "Description Engilish": "Augmented reality (AR) makes it possible to create immersive localization visualizations. These visualizations integrate with the real world, allowing users to perceive virtual objects as if they actually exist. The author proposes two novel immersive visualization methods for geospatial quantitative point data, which connect AR bar charts in real environments with virtual AR charts or maps. The self centered bar chart combines virtual bars placed in real landscapes with virtual 360 ° bar charts arranged around users. A circular map with bars combines the bars in the real landscape with a 360 ° virtual map that displays bar charts. These visualization designs are used to examine the position and attributes of individual points, as well as to understand the spatial and non spatial patterns of a set of points.\nWe conducted a study involving 12 participants to evaluate the reading accuracy and efficiency of these two visualizations, observed at a skyscraper in the center of the Melbourne metropolitan area. In order to better control for confounding factors, this study used virtual environments instead of AR settings. We found that compared to the bars placed in the landscape, the two suggestions had better visualization effects and received positive feedback from the study participants. In terms of estimation and comparison, the self centered bar chart visualization is the most accurate, while the circular map display with bars also has potential room for improvement. Our results demonstrate the potential of AR technology in conveying geospatial point data in outdoor environments through immersive bar charts.",

    "Description Engilish": "The ubiquity, localization, and physical visualization provide new possibilities for contextualizing tasks in the real world, such as doctors inserting needles. In the development process of situational visualization, evaluation visualization is a core requirement. However, conducting such assessments is difficult in practical scenarios, as real-world scenarios often involve safety critical or expensive testing. To overcome these issues, researchers and practitioners have adopted classic methods from ubiquitous computing and used alternative empirical methods such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) prototypes, or online demonstrations only.\nThe main assumption of this method is that meaningful insights can also be obtained from different, usually cheaper, and less cumbersome empirical methods. However, recent efforts by the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) community have found evidence against this hypothesis, which may hinder the use of alternative empirical methods. Currently, these insights are based on a single survey of four interacting objects. The goal of this study is to investigate whether these previous findings are also applicable to situational visualization. Therefore, we first created a scenario where situational visualization supports users to perform DIY tasks such as handcrafting and assembly. Then, we set up five empirical research methods to evaluate these four tasks using online surveys as well as VR, AR, laboratory, and in situ studies. Through this research design, we conducted a new study with a total of 60 participants. Our results show that the situation visualization investigated in this study is not easily affected by the same dependence on empirical methods found in previous work. Our study is the first to demonstrate that analyzing situational visualization through different empirical (surrogate) methods may yield comparable results.",

    "Description Engilish": "Collaborative visual analysis utilizes social interaction to support data exploration and meaning construction. These processes are typically envisioned as formal, ongoing activities involving a group of professional experts who are proficient in using complex data analysis tools. However, there are many professional fields that can benefit from supporting brief data exploration among a subset of stakeholders with broad knowledge backgrounds. This \"informal collaboration\" scenario will require eye-catching features to attract user attention, as well as an intuitive \"anytime, anywhere\" interface. This article introduces Uplift, a novel prototype system aimed at supporting \"informal collaborative visual analysis\" of campus microgrids, designed in collaboration with local stakeholders. Through guided seminars with key members of the building management team, it was revealed that relevant knowledge is distributed among multiple experts in their team, each using specialized analytical tools.\nUplift combines captivating 3D models with central desktop display, providing intuitive and tangible interaction, as well as augmented reality and aerial data visualization, to support informal collaborative visual analysis in this complex field. During and after prototype development, evaluations were conducted on professional stakeholders in the fields of building management and energy, and the results showed that Uplift was successful as a prominent background for informal collaboration. Experts believe that such a system has high potential in gathering diverse knowledge holders, revealing its domain structure, and complex interactions in operations and finance. Such systems also have further potential in other fields that require collaborative discussions or models, predictions, or cost-benefit analysis demonstrations among senior stakeholders.",

Our \"synchronous world\" vision is based on physical models, which dynamically and concurrently integrate visualizations of multiple data streams. To explore the potential of this concept, we conducted three design explorations using a lighting campus model to integrate visual information on building energy use, climate, and movement paths in university campuses.\nWe adopted a research through design approach and documented how our interdisciplinary collaborations with domain experts, students, and architects provided information for our designs. Based on our observations, we have described the advantages of the model in the following aspects: 1) localization visualization; 2) Composition visualization; 3) Operate and write visualizations. Our work highlights the potential of physical models in enabling embodied exploration of spatial and non spatial visualization through fluid interaction.",

    "Description Engilish": "Sports competition data has become increasingly complex, typically including multivariate data such as player performance statistics, historical team records, and athlete position tracking information. Although many visual analysis systems have been developed for sports analysts to extract insights, there are few tools targeted at fans to improve their understanding and participation in sports data during live matches. By presenting additional data in actual game views, embedded visualization has the potential to enhance the gaming experience for fans. However, we know very little about how to design such visualizations embedded in live competitions. In this work, we propose a user centered design study to develop interactive embedded visualization aimed at improving the on-site viewing experience for basketball fans.\nWe first conducted a formative study to describe the analytical behavior and tasks of basketball fans during games. Based on our findings, we propose a design framework to guide embedded visualization design based on specific data seeking scenarios. Based on the design framework, we propose five novel embedded visualization designs targeting five representative scenarios determined by fans, including shooting, offense, defense, player evaluation, and team comparison. Then, we developed \"Omnioculars\" - an interactive basketball game viewing prototype that includes embedded visualization for analyzing game data for fans. We evaluated Omnoculars with basketball fans in a simulated basketball game. The research results indicate that our design supports personalized competition data analysis and enhances understanding and participation in competitions.",

We present an example of an immersive flow map that includes a range of novel expressive gesture interactions that align with the proposed design considerations. Sensory interaction allows users to directly manipulate immersive flow graphs and explore origin destination flow data in novel ways.

We have developed a flexible XR prototype process framework with different fidelity levels. This framework combines our experience with the challenges faced by remote work to provide solutions for on-site problems. We demonstrated how to develop different XR prototypes using the proposed framework, such as micro laboratory prototypes, mixed use cases using indirect AR, off site VR prototypes, and actual on-site AR prototypes.

    "Source link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8114581",
    "Description Engilish": "The HoloBee we are introducing is a system that utilizes a head mounted augmented reality interface (Microsoft HoloLens) to visually analyze bee drift data. HoloBee can facilitate interactive manipulation and exploration of bee activity data on three-dimensional geographic terrain, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of bee drift behavior in their natural habitats. We conducted a user study comparing the task performance and user experience of HoloBee with traditional desktop applications. The results showed that although participants had much more experience interacting with the desktop interface, HoloBee was able to complete tasks in a similar amount of time and with high accuracy compared to the desktop interface. We have received positive feedback from some participants regarding the natural and intuitive interaction provided by HoloBee, while others prefer to use desktop applications. We will discuss the significance and limitations of these results and provide guidance for future work in this area.",

    "Description Engilish": "Some movements in modern architecture emphasize the importance of matching buildings with their surrounding environment. However, practicing this kind of \"situational architecture\" is very challenging, and often the future residents of the building do not have enough ability to participate. This article explores the potential of using mobile phone technology to promote the participation of such customers in various parts of the construction process at construction sites. To this end, we introduced ArchiLens, a mobile system for interactive on-site 3D visualization of houses, and the results of field research conducted on 40 participants during the construction or renovation of houses. Research has shown that using this system helps to evoke people's imagination of the appearance and feel of future houses, and to imagine them in the background. This enables them to participate more closely in the on-site design process by iteratively reviewing design proposals and exploring other layouts and materials.",
